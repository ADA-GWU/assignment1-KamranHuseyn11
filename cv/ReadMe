Hi, This is Kamran Huseynov's repository for assignment1 tasks from Intro to Computer Vision Course
All the code can be run from assignment1.ipynb notebook file. There are some explanations for the code and 7 task sections respective to assignment_1's requirements.

4 images are taken for first task: 
image_day - image taken under daylight at noon
image_night - image taken under daylight at evening
image_bright - image taken under bright fluorescent light
image_dim - image taken under dim fluorescent light.

Besides these 4 images there are several folders corresponding to task parts. 

To run the code you can use environment.yml file to create conda environment.

|| conda env create -f environment.yml || in your terminal which will create the conda environment named "kh_hw1env". 

Then you can easily activate the environment go to the notebook file and run it.
